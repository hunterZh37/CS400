Once upon a time, a knight was casted out of his kingdom for treason that he did not commmit. He knew that he was set up by one of the spy knight in the knight team. 
He decided to find out the truth...
He began his journey...

This once-noble knight knew that in order to clear his name, he had to find a way to find the spy and bring him to the King.
He knew the best place to find someone like that would be within the Grand Castle at the heart of the kingdom.
Heart filled with resolve, he made the difficult journey, hiding from the knights and peasants he once served.
At long last, entering through a hidden passageway in the rear of the castle, he enters, undetected...

He silently makes his way around the castle, room to room, looking for the spy. Finally he sees him talking to the King. 
This is perfect! He doesn't even have to bring the spy to the king because the spy is already with the king! He enters the
room and the king and spy turn around. 
"You shouldn't have come back here" said the spy as he grabs his sword.
"Wait!" The king shouts. He turns to me "Why are you here? You could be hanged for what you did."
Caught off guard by the king's hesitation, I explained everything right then. 
The king turned to the knight, "What do you have to say about this?"
The knight looked at the king, then me, then ran off.
"Ah.." said the king. He then turned to me and gave me his crown.
I became the new king and the kingdom lived happily ever after.
