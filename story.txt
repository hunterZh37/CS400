Once upon a time, a knight was casted out of his kingdom for treason that he did not commmit. He knew that he was set up by one of the spy knight in the knight team. 
He decided to find out the truth...
He began his journey...

He knew the best place to find someone like that would be within the Grand Castle at the heart of the kingdom.
Heart filled with resolve, he made the difficult journey, hiding from the knights and peasants he once served.
At long last, entering through a hidden passageway in the rear of the castle, he enters, undetected...
